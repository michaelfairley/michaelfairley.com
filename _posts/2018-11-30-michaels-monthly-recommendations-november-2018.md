I read, watch, listen to, play, and use a ton of different things every month, and I pick out a few of my favorites to recommend.

A "RogueVania", where the game is different each time you play it, but you also earn abilities and items that are available on future runs.
Solid action platforming with tough-but-fair combat.

[Little Fires Everywhere](https://smile.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng-ebook/dp/B01N4VW75U?tag=yelriaf-20)

Enjoyable novel about a group of suburban families and the drama in their idyllic town.
It shines an interesting spotlight on socio-economic class relations within suburbia, which isn't a thing I normally see receive much focus.

[The Purpose of Water](https://ded.increpare.com/~locus/ZweckDesWassers/)

Dark and mysterious puzzle game that's worth 20 minutes of your time.

<span class="mmr-heading">
[Toward Practical Telepathy](http://longnow.org/seminars/02018/oct/29/toward-practical-telepathy/)
</span>&nbsp;<span class="mmr-creator">
Seminars About Long-term Thinking
</span>  
Super interesting talk about some technology in development that provides MRI-like imaging, but cheap and portable.
The talk explores some of the ramifications this technology could have on human-computer interaction, since cheap, real-time brain imaging would allow for near telepathic interaction with computers.

I basically rescind my recommendation of _Enlightenment Now_ from [March](/blog/michaels-monthly-recommendations-march-2018/) in favor of this book.
It has a very similar theme ("Humanity has progressed a ton in the last 50 years! _Especially_ outside of the richest countries."), but with half as many words, much less condescension, and a stronger focus on how the advances affect the daily lives of average people (e.g. living conditions, education, health care).

I made a small game for the GitHub Game Off.
It's chess, but you can "attack" your own pieces to merge them.
