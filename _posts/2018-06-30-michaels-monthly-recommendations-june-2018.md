A disturbing podcast that follows around a New York Times reporter as she researches ISIS.
She tracks down and interviews a Canadian man who joined ISIS in Syria but later returned to Canada, talks to women who were enslaved by ISIS, and charges into Mosul with Iraqi forces in order to find whatever documents were left as ISIS fled.
