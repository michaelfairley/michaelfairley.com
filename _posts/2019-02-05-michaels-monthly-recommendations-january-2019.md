I read, watch, listen to, play, and use a ton of different things, and each month, I pick out a few of my favorites to recommend.

[Goodbye Big Five](https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five)

A journalist completely cuts each of the five big tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple) – including all of their subsidiaries and anything hosted on their web service platforms – out of her life for a week at a time.
Her experiments reveal how embedded these comparies are in each of our lives, especially in subtle ways that you wouldn't normally think of.
For instance, in the week she blocked Google, she couldn't use Lyft or Uber (because both use Google Maps and won't let you set a pickup location if Maps is blocked), and she also couldn't log in to Dropbox (because it uses [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) on its login page).

[Gestalt_OS](https://games.increpare.com/Gestalt_OS/)
</span> (Play for free in your browser)&nbsp;<span class="mmr-creator">
Stephen Lavelle and Lucas Le Slo
</span>  
An instructionless puzzle game where you have to learn the meanings of mysterious symbols through experimentation.
And it looks like Windows 95.

If you enjoy it and manage to play through the whole thing, there's also [Gestalt_3.1](https://games.increpare.com/Gestalt_3_1/).

[Daily Overview](http://www.dailyoverview.com/)

Daily Overview uses satelite and drone imagery to inspire awe with views of the Earth that you've never seen before.
I recommend scrolling through their [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/dailyoverview/), listening to [this lecture + interview](http://longnow.org/seminars/02018/may/22/overview-earth-and-civilization-macroscope/) with the founder, or buying their [coffee table book](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/039957865X?tag=yelriaf-20).

[Game Engine Black Book: Doom](https://smile.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Black-Book-Doom/dp/1987418433?tag=yelriaf-20)

Take what I said [last year](/blog/michaels-monthly-recommendations-february-2018/) about the previous book in this series, and replace every instance of "Wolfenstein 3D" with "Doom".
