A woman regularly receives packages she didn't order, filled with junk she doesn't want.
It turns out they're part of a clever scheme to game online marketplace reviews, and Planet Money hunts down the full story about how it all works.

(Oh, and if you don't enjoy the first 40 or so pages -- I certainly didn't -- keep reading anyway!)
