[Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc)

Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen
</span>  
A month ago, I knew basically nothing about quantum computing.
Thanks to this essay (as well as their [follow-up](https://quantum.country/search/) and [this lecture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/quantum-computing-computer-scientists/) I happened to watch around the same time), I now have a pretty decent grasp of the basics of how quantum computers work and how to design algorithms for them.

This essay also tries something extra interesting: it has built in spaced repetition flashcards, and after you finish reading it, it will regularly email you with reviews of the material, helping you retain the information long-term.
