This is a cookbook that focuses on teaching _how_ to cook (rather than _what_ to cook, as most collection-of-recipes cookbooks do).
The first half (200 pages!) of the book covers four central components of almost every recipe – salt, fat, acid, and heat – and how to appropriately and skillfully make use of them in your cooking.
The second half of the book is a collection of recipes that focus on using the techniques that you learn in the first half of the book.

I learned a ton reading this book, and the food I've cooked over the past few weeks has definitely been tastier as a result.
If you cook, this is absolutely worth a read.

Fascinating story about a computer programmer who ended up running an international criminal empire, whose activity included all sorts of absurd things like exporting meth from North Korea, smuggling black market gold out of Ghana, and running their own domain registrar in order to issue new domains for online "pharmacies" faster than they were getting shut down.
